Description: The purpose of the package is to identify prognostic biomarkers and an optimal numeric cutoff for each biomarker that can be used to stratify a group of test subjects (samples) into two sub-groups with significantly different survival (better vs. worse). The package was developed for the analysis of gene expression data, such as RNA-seq. However, it can be used with any quantitative variable that has a sufficiently large proportion of unique values.
